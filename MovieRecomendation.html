<h1>The Best Movies According to Preethi</h1>
 <h2>My Top 3 Movies all-time</h2>
 
 <hr />
<h3> 3 Idiots</h3>
  <p> It's an Popular Hindi Language film<br />
    It tells about the story of 3 engineering students. I really like the phrase "ALL IS WELL" which is from the movie.</p>
<h3>Gunjan Saxena: The Kargil Girl</h3>
    <p>It tells the life story of the only women in the air force who participated in the kargil war. It tells about how her dreams of flying an airplane made her landed in air force.<br />
      It's such a motivating story which is telling us that never give up your dreams! </p>
<h3>Kalki 2898 AD</h3>
<p>It's a SCI-FI action film<br />
    It's such an story like mixing elements which are present in the Hindu books and making a story out of it. It gave me goosebumps! Must watch movie!</p>
